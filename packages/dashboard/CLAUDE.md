# CLAUDE.md — `@anvil-dev/dashboard`

Guidance for Claude Code when working inside `packages/dashboard/`. The
dashboard is the WebSocket+HTTP server that drives Anvil's per-run
pipeline orchestrator, plus the React UI rendered against it. Single
process; the boot orchestrator (`server/dashboard-server.ts`) was
decomposed from ~8,300 LOC to ~890 LOC over a 12-round refactor — the
extracted modules live under `server/{setup,handlers,pipeline,http,runs,shared,sandbox,services,events,ws,dev,tools,browser,computer-use,steps,runners}/`. See `DASHBOARD-DECOMPOSITION-PLAN.md` for round-by-round history.

## What this package owns

- **`server/dashboard-server.ts`** (~890 LOC) — boot + lifecycle only:
  loads env, builds the `DashboardStores` bundle, constructs services +
  legacy bridge + socket.io mount, wires the handler registry, threads
  the `HandlerExtras` closure bag, returns the `DashboardServerHandle`.
  Top-of-file invokes `loadAnvilEnv(ANVIL_HOME)` /
  `ensureQuietOtelLogs()` / `autoDetectTelemetry()`. WS event vocabulary
  is typed (`DashboardEvent` union in `server/events/types.ts`).
- **`server/setup/`** — boot-time wiring extracted out of
  `dashboard-server.ts`:
    - `load-env.ts` — `ALLOWED_ENV_KEYS` + `loadAnvilEnv(anvilHome)` +
      `autoDetectTelemetry()` + `ensureQuietOtelLogs()`. Single source
      of truth for the env-var write contract.
    - `stores.ts` — `createDashboardStores(deps)` collapses ~26
      `new XxxStore(ANVIL_HOME)` calls into one factory returning a
      typed `DashboardStores` bundle (plan / review / test / incident /
      KB / cost / pauses / manifest / memory / feature / runs /
      ci-triage / reviewers / dismissals / learnings / regression /
      replay / durable / approval / bound-tests / contract / browser /
      flakiness / shared cost-pricing).
    - `init-payload.ts` — `createInitSender(deps)` returns the
      `SendInitFn` that pushes the projects/runs/state/models/repos
      bootstrap blob on WS connect. Takes a `getOutputBuffer()` getter
      so rebound `let outputBuffer = []` semantics survive.
    - `model-discovery.ts` — `discoverAvailableModels()` walks
      `~/.anvil/models.yaml` + provider env-var presence; returns the
      typed `AvailableModelsResult` consumed by the Settings UI.
    - `server-listen.ts` — terminal `listenAndReturnHandle(deps)` block
      that mounts socket.io, builds the `fauxWsForSocket` adapter, and
      drains `stopHandlers` with per-handler 2 s timeouts on
      `handle.stop()`.
    - `graceful-shutdown.ts` — SIGINT+SIGTERM hooks calling
      `agentManager.killAll()` + 3 s force-exit watchdog.
    - `auto-replay.ts` / `restore-incomplete.ts` / `sleeptime.ts` —
      background daemons started at boot (replay queue, incomplete-run
      restore sweep, memory-core sleeptime ratification).
    - `ws-client.ts` — shared `WsClient` type + `WS_OPEN = 1`.
- **`server/handlers/`** — WS client action handlers (one per
  domain) dispatched via Recipe-7 handler registry:
    - `registry.ts` + `route.ts` — typed dispatch over `ClientMessage`.
      Each handler takes `(msg, extras: HandlerExtras)` and returns
      `Promise<void>`. Unknown actions log + drop, never crash the
      server.
    - `extras-builder.ts` — `buildHandlerExtras(deps): HandlerExtras`
      flattens 40+ deps into a typed bag. Mutable refs via
      `getActivePipelineRunner` / `setActivePipelineRunner` /
      `getActiveChild` callbacks. Spawn closures wrapped in thunks at
      call site to handle declaration-order.
    - One file per domain: `projects`, `runs-pipeline`, `plans` +
      `plans-spawn`, `reviews` + `reviews-spawn`, `tests` +
      `tests-pipeline`, `incidents` + `incidents-spawn`,
      `contracts`, `pauses`, `cost`, `kb`, `project-graph`,
      `learnings`, `ci-triage`, `settings`, `schemas` (Zod input
      validation).
- **`server/pipeline/`** — pipeline-side spawn / cancel / lifecycle
  helpers extracted out of the runner + handlers:
    - `start-pipeline.ts` — `startPipeline()` registers the run on
      `activeRuns` + broadcasts BEFORE `new PipelineRunner(...)`;
      seeds the activity feed with an "Initialising pipeline…" entry.
    - `cancel-legacy.ts` — `createCancelLegacyPipeline(deps)` returns
      the SIGTERM-then-state-flip canceller.
    - `quick-action.ts` / `plan-spawn.ts` / `review-spawn.ts` —
      one-shot agent spawns for ad-hoc commands.
    - `post-run.ts` / `pr-tracking.ts` / `plan-lifecycle.ts` /
      `cost-breach-router.ts` / `review-helpers.ts` /
      `project-overview.ts` / `json-extract.ts`.
- **`server/runs/io.ts`** — `loadRunsSync(runsIndex)` +
  `readStateFile(stateFile)` as pure path-arg readers; the server
  wraps them in `() => loadRunsSync(RUNS_INDEX)` thunks to preserve
  the deps-fn shape downstream.
- **`server/http/`** — non-WS HTTP surface:
    - `static.ts` — `createStaticHandler(deps)` MIME-typed Vite
      `dist/` server with directory-traversal protection.
    - `webhook-routes.ts` — `POST /webhooks/incidents` /
      `POST /webhooks/bound-tests` etc.
- **`server/shared/`** — types + workspace helpers hoisted out of the
  monolith:
    - `server-types.ts` — `ProjectSummary`, `RunSummary`,
      `DashboardStageState`, `DashboardPipeline`, `DashboardState`,
      `ServerMessage`, `ClientMessage`, `DashboardServerOptions`,
      `DashboardServerHandle`.
    - `workspace.ts` — `getWorkspaceFromConfig(project)` +
      `parseFixPatternContent(content)` pure helpers.
- **`server/sandbox/`** — workload sandboxing (overlay-fs upper layer
  + container runners). Used by `agent-core`'s `BuiltinToolExecutor`
  when `SANDBOX_HANDLE` is threaded through the spawn config (see
  recent commits 9d8e513 / c7ceb14 / e15334a):
    - `docker-runner.ts` / `firecracker-runner.ts` / `gvisor-runner.ts`
      — three substrate impls behind a shared interface.
    - `overlay-fs.ts` — tmpfs upper layer + state-hash binding for
      reproducible runBash invocations.
    - `pool.ts` / `pooled-runner.ts` — warm-instance pool.
    - `cache-mounts.ts` / `docker-image.ts` /
      `install-exec-wrapper.ts` / `network-policy.ts` /
      `resource-limits.ts` / `register-at-boot.ts`.
- **`server/events/`** — typed event infrastructure (Phase 2–6 of the
  WS extraction):
    - `types.ts` — `DashboardEvent` discriminated union (~60 event
      kinds across run lifecycle, agent stream, pipeline, plans,
      reviews, tests, incidents, KB, cost, project-graph, bind,
      artifact, system). `Topic` enum for socket.io room routing.
      `envelope()` + `nextEventId()` helpers.
    - `replay.ts` — `EventReplay` ring buffer per topic, bounded by
      both event count (default 500) and bytes (default 1 MiB)
      whichever-hits-first. Used by socket.io's `subscribe { since }`
      backfill on reconnect.
    - `topics.ts` — `roomsForEvent(ev)` map (ts-pattern exhaustive
      switch). Adding a new event kind without a topic mapping is a
      compile error.
    - `bridge.ts` — `attachLegacyBridge` subscribes to every service's
      `onAny` and translates each typed emission back to today's
      `{type,payload}` wire shape via `broadcast()`. Keeps the React
      frontend (still raw-WS) working unchanged during migration.
    - `wire-translate.ts` — explicit per-kind unwrap of typed payloads
      into the legacy wire shape (e.g. `run.active-snapshot` →
      `payload: array` instead of `{runs}`). This divergence is the
      reason `src/state/reducer.ts` accepts BOTH shapes per case.
    - `services-bridge.ts` — sibling that fans typed events into
      socket.io rooms via `io.to(rooms).emit`. Used only when
      `mountSocketServer({ coexistWithRawWs: true })` is active
      (env-gated by `ANVIL_SOCKET_IO=1`).
    - `sync-emitter.ts` — synchronous typed pub/sub base class. Used
      instead of Emittery because Emittery dispatches listeners on a
      microtask, which would reorder typed emissions against any
      sibling synchronous `broadcast()` calls and break wire ordering
      (e.g. `stop-run` → `active-runs` → kill chain).
- **`server/services/index.ts`** — domain-scoped event services (one
  `SyncEmitter` subclass per domain): `RunService`, `AgentService`,
  `PipelineService`, `ReviewService`, `PlanService`, `TestService`,
  `BindService`, `IncidentService`, `KbService`, `CostService`,
  `ProjectGraphService`, `SystemService`. `createServices()` returns
  the full bundle; injected via `DashboardServerDeps.services`.
- **`server/ws/socket-server.ts`** — `mountSocketServer({...})` boots
  socket.io. Two modes:
    - default: socket.io's `attach(server)` takes over the http
      server's request listener. Suitable for isolated tests.
    - `coexistWithRawWs: true`: socket.io uses `noServer: true` plus a
      manual upgrade-router that filters `/socket.io/*` URLs and lets
      the raw `WebSocketServer({ path: '/ws' })` keep owning `/ws`.
      This is the production path until raw-WS is removed.
- **`shared/events.ts`** — re-exports from `server/events/types.ts` so
  both the Node server AND the Vite frontend import event types from a
  single namespace.
- **`src/state/reducer.ts`** — pure reducer over `DashboardEvent`.
  Replaces the imperative `handleServerMessage` switch in
  `main.tsx:443`. Includes `wireToEvent(wire)` adapter that converts
  the legacy `{type,payload}` wire shape into a typed envelope so the
  reducer can switch on `kind`. **Wire-shape divergence**: the bridge
  unwraps some typed payloads (`run.active-snapshot` → array,
  `runs.list` → array, `state` → state, `prs.updated` → array) so
  every case that reads payload fields MUST accept both the typed
  envelope (`{runs: [...]}`) and the unwrapped raw shape (`[...]`).
  Don't add a case that only reads one shape — it'll crash with
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` for whichever
  hop didn't unwrap. ts-pattern's `.exhaustive()` makes adding a new
  event kind a compile error if the reducer doesn't handle it.
- **`server/__tests__/_harness/`** — scenario-test infrastructure
  (Phase 0.5):
    - `boot.ts` — `bootDashboard()` boots a fresh dashboard on an
      ephemeral port with a tmp ANVIL_HOME and an injected
      `FakeAgentManager` (zero real LLM calls).
    - `dashboard-client.ts` — `DashboardClient` abstraction with two
      transport impls (`rawWsClient` / `socketIoClient`); scenario
      tests are transport-agnostic.
    - `fake-agent-manager.ts` — `FakeAgentManager extends AgentManager`
      with scripted spawn/emit/done/error. Lets scenarios pin the
      wire-level contract of agent lifecycle without real LLM
      spawns.
    - `strip-volatile.ts` + `snapshot-store.ts` — snapshot
      normalization + file-based pinning (`__tests__/snapshots/*.snap`).
- **`server/dev/ws-trace.ts`** — opt-in JSONL writer for `broadcast()`
  emissions. When `ANVIL_WS_TRACE=1`, every legacy-shape broadcast
  appends `{ts, type, callerHash}` to `$ANVIL_HOME/ws-trace.jsonl`.
  Used during the migration to inventory event types; safe to keep
  shipping since it no-ops when the env var is unset.
- **`server/pipeline-runner.ts`** (~560 LOC) — per-run orchestrator.
  Drives via `Pipeline.run()` from `core-pipeline` over an
  `InMemoryStepRegistry` built from `STAGES` in core-pipeline; each
  Step's `run` calls `runOneStage(i)` which contains the per-stage body
  (resume skip, planSeed branch, dispatch to clarify/perRepo/single,
  validate-fix loop, after-stage hook, ship deploy). Control-flow exits
  (`continue` / `break` / early-return / reviewer rewind) translate to
  thrown sentinel errors with `__anvilCancel` / `__anvilFailReturn` /
  `__anvilRewind` markers; the outer try unwinds to the right exit.
  Reviewer rewind is handled by trimming `completedSteps` and
  re-invoking `Pipeline.run()` from the rewind target. The runner
  emits to its own `EventEmitter` (`state-change`, `waiting-for-input`,
  `clarify-question`, etc.); `dashboard-server.ts` subscribes via
  `runner.on(...)` and translates each event to the appropriate
  `services.<X>.emit(...)` typed call. Bus subscribers
  (`attachAuditLogHook`, `attachCostTrackerHook` from core-pipeline)
  are wired to the runner's `pipelineBus` for forensic audit + cost
  rollup.
- **`server/prompt-context-cache.ts`** — memoised system-prompt
  inputs (memory block, conventions, project YAML slice, KB block,
  manifest). `formatContent(content: unknown)` JSON-stringifies
  non-string memory entries before `.replace()`-style normalization,
  because `semantic:fix-pattern` memories from sleeptime store
  `{error, fix}` objects, not strings. Previously crashed pipeline
  start with `TypeError: content.replace is not a function` —
  logged as `[pipeline] BM25 memory retrieval failed`.
- **`server/steps/`** — Step factories + pure helpers extracted out
  of `pipeline-runner.ts` over the Phase-4 series. See README §
  "Pipeline runner shape (Phase 4)" for the full module table.
- **`server/runners/`** — adapters that satisfy the canonical
  `AgentRunner` / `AgentSession` interfaces (from `core-pipeline`)
  over the dashboard's heavyweight `AgentManager`:
    - `agent-manager-runner.ts` — `AgentManagerRunner` is the one-shot
      runner. Wraps `spawnAndWait` + `runWithChainFallback`. Used by
      `runOneStage`'s single-stage / per-repo / per-task delegations.
    - `agent-manager-session.ts` — `AgentManagerSession` is the
      multi-turn session. Wraps `agentManager.spawn` for `start()` and
      `agentManager.sendInput + waitForAgent` for `sendInput()`. Used
      by clarify (explore→Q&A→synthesize) and fix-loop (resume across
      attempts).
    - `pipeline-step-registry.ts` — `buildPipelineStepRegistry(opts)`
      assembles the `InMemoryStepRegistry` driven by `Pipeline.run()`.
- **`server/provider-registry.ts`** — discovery layer for the Settings
  UI. Reports each provider's display name, env var, model list,
  setup hint. Visibility toggles on env-var presence.
- **`server/provider-liveness.ts`** — thin re-export shim over
  `@esankhan3/anvil-agent-core`'s provider-liveness module. The
  implementation moved to agent-core so cli + dashboard share one
  module-scoped probe cache.
- **`server/memory-store.ts`** — thin façade over
  `@anvil/memory-core`'s `HybridMemoryStore`, with the dashboard's
  legacy markdown-migration path on first read/write.
- **`server/feature-store.ts`** — owns
  `~/.anvil/features/<project>/<slug>/` artifacts (CLARIFICATION.md,
  REQUIREMENTS.md, …).
- **`server/knowledge-base-manager.ts`** — wraps the cli's `anvil index`
  command so KB indexing runs out-of-process.
- **`scripts/copy-out.mjs`** — post-`tsc` walker that mirrors
  `server/out/**/*` into `server/**/*` recursively (excluding
  `__tests__`). Replaces the previous hardcoded `cp` chain that broke
  every time a new subdirectory was added. Filter: `.js` / `.d.ts` /
  `.map`. Without it the cli bundle silently misses `services/`,
  `setup/`, `handlers/`, `pipeline/`, `http/`, `runs/`, `shared/`,
  `sandbox/` at import time.
- **`src/`** — React + Vite frontend. Mounts on the WS server's port,
  renders run history, change diffs, activity log, KB graph,
  pipeline-policy editor, settings. Phase-4 pipeline event vocabulary
  is rendered by `src/components/output/`.
- **`server/events/`** — typed event infrastructure (Phase 2–6 of the
  WS extraction):
    - `types.ts` — `DashboardEvent` discriminated union (~60 event
      kinds across run lifecycle, agent stream, pipeline, plans,
      reviews, tests, incidents, KB, cost, project-graph, bind,
      artifact, system). `Topic` enum for socket.io room routing.
      `envelope()` + `nextEventId()` helpers.
    - `replay.ts` — `EventReplay` ring buffer per topic, bounded by
      both event count (default 500) and bytes (default 1 MiB)
      whichever-hits-first. Used by socket.io's `subscribe { since }`
      backfill on reconnect.
    - `topics.ts` — `roomsForEvent(ev)` map (ts-pattern exhaustive

## Build + test

```sh
npm -w @anvil-dev/dashboard run build       # tsc + Vite
npm -w @anvil-dev/dashboard run test:server # node --test on server out/
npm -w @anvil-dev/dashboard run dev         # Vite frontend on 5173
node packages/dashboard/server/dashboard-server.js   # WS+HTTP backend
```

The build pipeline is `vite build && tsc -p server/tsconfig.json &&
node ./scripts/copy-out.mjs`. `tsc` writes to `server/out/`;
`copy-out.mjs` walks the tree recursively and mirrors every
`.js` / `.d.ts` / `.map` (skipping `__tests__`) back into
`server/**/` so the cli can `dynamic import` without a build step on
the user's machine. **Adding a new server subdirectory requires no
copy-out change** — the walker picks it up automatically. The
`package.json` `files` field follows the same convention
(`server/**/*.js`, `server/**/*.d.ts`).

Vite is configured with `sourcemap: true` so a crashed stack trace
in the browser shows the original `src/...` filename + line, not the
minified bundle position. **Important**: never let a stale
`vite.config.js` / `.js.map` / `.d.ts` from a previous `tsc` run sit
alongside the `.ts` — Vite prefers the `.js` and silently ignores
the `.ts` config (the canonical "sourcemaps not generated despite
config change" symptom).

## Conventions

### Typed event emission — never call `broadcast()` directly

The WS extraction (Phases 0–6) replaced ~90+ inline `broadcast({ type, payload })`
call sites with typed `services.<X>.emit(kind, payload)` emissions. Adding a
new wire event MUST follow this recipe — bypassing it (i.e., calling
`broadcast(...)` directly again) is the canonical regression because the
new event won't appear in `EventReplay`, won't route correctly across
socket.io rooms, and won't be exhaustively matched by the frontend reducer.

**Adding a new event:**

1. Add a new `EventEnvelope<'kind.subkind', PayloadType>` alias to
   `server/events/types.ts` and add it to the `DashboardEvent` union.
2. Add a `.with({ kind: 'kind.subkind' }, … )` clause to
   `server/events/topics.ts` (ts-pattern errors if missing).
3. Add a `.with({ kind: 'kind.subkind' }, e => ({ type: 'kind-subkind',
   payload: e.payload }) as LegacyMessage)` clause to
   `server/events/bridge.ts` (ts-pattern errors if missing).
4. Add the kind to the appropriate service's `EventMap` interface in
   `server/services/index.ts` so `services.<X>.emit('kind.subkind', ...)`
   is typed.
5. Emit at the call site: `services.<X>.emit('kind.subkind', payload)`.

Both the legacy bridge (raw-WS → React frontend) and the socket.io
bridge fan typed emissions to subscribers automatically. No further
plumbing needed.

**The synchronous-emit invariant.** Services extend `SyncEmitter`, not
Emittery. Emittery dispatches every listener on a microtask, which
would reorder bridge-driven `broadcast()` calls against sibling
synchronous broadcasts (e.g. the `stop-run` handler must emit
`run-stopped` BEFORE the kill-chain emits agent events — see the 1.3
scenario in `__tests__/run-lifecycle.test.ts`). `SyncEmitter` calls
listeners in-line during `emit()` so wire ordering is preserved.

### socket.io coexists with raw WS, env-gated

`mountSocketServer` runs in two modes; the dashboard always uses
`coexistWithRawWs: true` to keep the React frontend working on raw WS
during the Phase 5–6 transition. The socket.io mount itself is gated
behind `ANVIL_SOCKET_IO=1`. Phase 7+ (frontend hook swap) will flip
the gate on by default and Phase 8 cleanup will delete the raw-WS
pipeline.

**Why the gate exists.** socket.io's `Server.attach(httpServer)`
replaces the http server's request listener, which can disrupt the
raw `WebSocketServer({ path: '/ws' })`. `coexistWithRawWs: true` uses
`noServer: true` + a manual upgrade router that filters `/socket.io/*`
URLs so both transports coexist. Tested in isolation (no dashboard
boot) by `__tests__/socket-io-smoke.test.ts`.

### Scenario tests: transport-agnostic by design

`DashboardClient` in `__tests__/_harness/dashboard-client.ts` is the
abstraction tests speak to. The harness picks the underlying transport
(`rawWsClient` today; can flip to `socketIoClient` for the same tests).
This is what makes Phase 7's transport swap a one-file edit, not a
test rewrite.

### Per-stage tool permissions

Every `spawnAndWait` call in `pipeline-runner.ts` MUST thread
`allowedTools: this.allowedToolsForCurrentStage(stageName)` into the
spawn spec — `LanguageModelBridge` reads this to scope the
`BuiltinToolExecutor` for non-Claude agentic adapters
(Ollama / OpenRouter / OpenCode). The five spawn sites are:
`runClarifyForProject`, generic per-repo (`runPerRepoStageForRepo`),
per-repo build (`runBuildForOneRepo`), single-stage (`spawnAndWait`),
and fix-loop (`runFixLoop`). Forgetting one is the canonical "qwen
ran but produced no diff" symptom.

### Chain-fallback on retryable upstream errors

`runStageWithFallback<T>(stageName, attemptFn)` (max attempts read from
`walker.max_attempts` in `~/.anvil/models.yaml`, default 5) wraps each
spawn site. When the inner attempt throws an `UpstreamError`-shape
(duck-typed: `name === 'UpstreamError' && retryable === true`), the
runner adds the failed model to `runtimeBurnedModels` and re-resolves
the stage's chain via `pickAliveModelFromChainSync(..., excludeModels=runtimeBurnedModels)`.
The 429/quota burst on Alibaba upstream for `qwen3.5-plus` (an
OpenCode→upstream provider quota issue, not the user's) is the
canonical case this guards.

The chain walker is reactive (post-failure burn) **plus** proactive
(pre-call liveness probe). `prefetchProviderLiveness` runs once at
pipeline start and probes every distinct provider in
`~/.anvil/models.yaml`'s `models:` array (auto-derived — no hardcoded
list). Cloud probes are env-var-presence only (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENCODE_API_KEY`, etc.); Ollama hits `localhost:11434/api/tags`;
ADK probes the union of Anthropic+Gemini keys (it dispatches to
either). Probe results cache for `walker.liveness_ttl_ms` (default
30000ms; set to 0 to disable caching). Probe + chain-walker live in
`server/provider-liveness.ts`.

### Per-repo stage atomicity

When a per-repo step fans out across N repos and any one repo fails,
the stage halts:

```ts
if (failedRepos.length > 0) throw new Error(`stage ${stage.name} failed for ${failedRepos.length} repo(s)`);
```

The earlier behavior — only halting when ALL repos failed — silently
advanced with a half-written codebase.

### Run-start visibility — register before any setup work

`startPipeline()` calls `activeRuns.set(pipelineRunId, {...})` +
`broadcastActiveRuns()` at the TOP of the function, before
`new PipelineRunner(...)`, before any hook wiring (cost ledger,
checkpoint cache, after-stage policy hook), and before
`runner.run()` is scheduled. The hook chain is synchronous JS but
still long enough that the Active Runs panel was visibly stale for a
beat after Build was clicked. A seed `kind:'project'` activity
(`"Initialising pipeline — workspace + provider liveness…"`) is
pushed into the run's activity feed and broadcast on the same tick,
so the per-stage Output panel isn't blank during the workspace +
walker prefetch gap. Do NOT move the registration back down — the
late-broadcast bug was the canonical "I clicked Build and nothing
happened" symptom.

### MCP for non-Claude adapters

Every spawned agent — Claude OR non-Claude — now sees MCP-server tools
when `mcp.json` is configured for the workspace. Naming follows Claude
Code's convention: `mcp__<server>__<tool>`.

- **Claude path**: unchanged. `defaultAdapterFactory` resolves the
  `mcp.json` path and forwards it to `claude-cli` via `--mcp-config`,
  which loads its own connections.
- **Non-Claude path** (ollama, openrouter, opencode, openai, gemini,
  adk, gemini-cli): `AgentProcess` constructs a session-scoped
  `McpClientPool` lazily on first `start()`, attaches it to
  `AdapterRequest.mcpPool`, and `LanguageModelBridge` wraps it together
  with the builtin executor in a `MergedToolExecutor`. Resume turns
  (`sendInput`) reuse the same pool — no reconnect cost. `kill()`
  cancels in-flight MCP calls (via `notifications/cancelled`) and
  closes the pool.
- **Per-stage allowlist** (`core-pipeline/src/routing/stage-permissions.ts`):
  `STAGE_MCP_ALLOW` declares which MCP tool ids each stage may call.
  `mcp__*` is a shortcut that the merged executor expands to per-server
  globs when the pool reports its server set. Destructive MCP tools
  (annotated `destructiveHint: true`) are hidden from the model unless
  the stage's allowlist names them exactly — opt-in per-tool, not
  per-server.
- **Failure isolation**: one server failing to connect doesn't fail the
  spawn. The pool records `{ server, reason }` in `failures[]`; the
  agent still runs with the other servers + the builtins.

### Stopping a build — broadcast first, kill chain after

`stop-run` flips `run.status='failed'` and emits the
`run-stopped` + `broadcastActiveRuns()` broadcasts FIRST, then calls
`runner.cancel()` and walks `agentToRunId` to kill every spawned
agent (deduped into a `Set` so a stage-tracked + map-tracked agent
isn't killed twice). Map entries are cleaned up as we go. The kill
chain (`AgentManager.kill` → `AgentProcess.kill` → `adapter.kill()`
→ per-call `AbortController`) severs in-flight HTTP requests on
Ollama/OpenRouter/OpenCode adapters and SIGTERM-s CLI subprocesses.
The UI sees the run flip immediately even though the async kill
unwind takes a few seconds for in-flight LLM calls.

### PR URL extraction from `tool_result`

`gh pr create`'s URL appears in the agent's `tool_result` content,
not in a top-level text block. The bridge's `handleUserBlocks` emits
a `kind:'text'` activity for each `tool_result` (capped at 4 KB) so
the dashboard's `extractPRUrls(content)` scanner picks it up. The
URL lands in the active run's `prUrls: Set<string>` and surfaces in
the run-history detail view as soon as `gh pr create` returns.

### Tool-naming convention in the Changes panel

Filter uses `Set` dispatch to accept BOTH Claude-CLI PascalCase
(`Edit`, `Write`, `file_path`) AND `BuiltinToolExecutor` snake_case
(`edit`, `write_file`, `path`):

```ts
const editTools  = new Set(['Edit', 'edit']);
const writeTools = new Set(['Write', 'write_file']);
const filePath   = input.file_path ?? input.path;
```

Without this, file changes from non-Claude adapters never render.

### `ALLOWED_ENV_KEYS` (the WS env-write contract)

`set-env-var` only writes keys present in `ALLOWED_ENV_KEYS`
(`server/dashboard-server.ts`). Adding a new provider env var
requires adding it here; otherwise the Settings UI cannot persist
the value.

Currently allowed (highlights):
- `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_BASE_URL`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` /
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`,
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
- `ANVIL_OTEL_CONSOLE`, `ANVIL_OTEL_DISABLED`,
  `ANVIL_OTEL_RECORD_CONTENT`, `ANVIL_ENV`

`test-auth` has a dedicated branch per provider (e.g. `opencode`
issues `GET /v1/models` with the Bearer token).

### OTel auto-detection

On startup `autoDetectTelemetry()` probes `localhost:3000` (HEAD on
`/`, ~800 ms). If alive AND the user hasn't already set
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, the dashboard auto-wires it to
`localhost:3000/api/public/otel/v1/traces` so the local Langfuse
stack at `infra/observability/docker-compose.yml` lights up with
zero config. `ANVIL_OTEL_DISABLED=1` short-circuits the probe;
`ANVIL_OTEL_CONSOLE=1` dumps spans to stderr.

### Project-prompt cache invariants (P1)

`buildProjectPromptHelper` / `buildRepoProjectPromptHelper` results
are cached on `pipeline-runner.ts` keyed by
`(projectId, repoName?, stageBucket)`. Mutating these prompts mid-run
breaks reproducibility — only invalidate on explicit `clearCache()`.

## Things that don't exist in this package (intentionally)

- No legacy if-tree orchestrator. The dashboard rides on
  `@anvil/core-pipeline` indirectly (via `pipeline-runner.ts`'s Step
  factories). The cli still has the legacy if-tree and the
  consolidation is in flight (see `CORE-PIPELINE-CONSOLIDATION-*.md`
  at the repo root).
- No feature flags. Per the dashboard-consolidation rule we don't
  gate behavior changes on flags — branch-parity diff replaces
  flag-gated rollout (see `feedback_no_feature_flags_dashboard_consolidation`
  in user memory).
- No vendor LLM SDK imports. All provider work routes through
  `@anvil/agent-core`'s `AgentManager`.
- No reimplementation of indexing / retrieval. `KnowledgeBaseManager`
  in `server/knowledge-base-manager.ts` is a thin wrapper: it
  dynamic-imports `@esankhan3/anvil-knowledge-core`'s `KnowledgeIndexer`
  + `getRetriever` for chunking, AST graph build, embeddings, LanceDB,
  and hybrid retrieval. The dashboard owns only the lifecycle layer on
  top — `origin/main` SHA resolution + detached `git worktree` so the
  user's working tree isn't touched, `getRepoStatus` / `getStatus` for
  the Project Overview UI (reads knowledge-core's `index_meta.json` for
  `lastIndexedSha` / `lastIndexedAt`), `SYSTEM_REPORT.md` deterministic
  synthesis (cheap companion to knowledge-core's LLM-driven
  `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`), `project_index.json` compact keyword index for
  prompt injection, yaml-based transport extraction, and the in-flight
  hybrid-context cache (`prefetchHybridContext`).

## Where to look first

- Adding a new pipeline stage? `core-pipeline/src/stages/registry.ts`
  is the canonical `STAGES` array; the per-stage body lives in
  `pipeline-runner.ts:runOneStage` (split by `stage.name`); the actual
  agent prompt + dispatch lives in `core-pipeline/src/stages/<name>.ts`.
- Pipeline orchestration end-to-end? `pipeline-runner.ts:run()` →
  builds `pipelineBus` + `buildPipelineStepRegistry` →
  `new Pipeline().run()`. Each Step's `run()` calls
  `runOneStage(i)`. Cancellation / fail-early-return / reviewer rewind
  flow through thrown sentinel errors.
- WS message vocabulary? `server/handlers/registry.ts` +
  `server/handlers/route.ts` are the typed dispatch surface. One
  handler file per domain under `server/handlers/<domain>.ts`. Don't
  add a `case '<msg>'` switch to `dashboard-server.ts` — register
  through the handler registry so it gets the typed `HandlerExtras`
  bag.
- Stage doing the wrong work (e.g. ship/validate editing source
  code instead of opening a PR / running tests)? Check
  `core-pipeline/src/routing/stage-permissions.ts` — `ship` and
  `validate` are currently `['read', 'write', 'exec']` so the model
  has `edit` + `write_file` even though the prompts forbid it. The
  prompt is a soft constraint; permissions are the hard one. Tighten
  perms before tightening prompts.
- Settings UI doesn't show a provider? `server/provider-registry.ts`
  detects via env-var presence; the Settings panel reads
  `discover-providers`.
- PR URLs not surfacing? Verify the bridge's `handleUserBlocks`
  emits `kind:'text'` for `tool_result` (the source of truth lives
  in `@anvil/agent-core`'s `language-model-bridge.ts`).
- Activity log shows one word per row? Check that the adapter's
  `emitContent` is buffered (flush on '\n' OR ~80 chars) — the
  pattern lives in agent-core's `OpenRouterAdapter` /
  `OllamaAdapter`.
- Per-repo stage advancing despite failures? Verify the
  `failedRepos.length > 0 → throw` branch in `pipeline-runner.ts`.
