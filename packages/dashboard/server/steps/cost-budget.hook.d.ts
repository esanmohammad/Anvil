/**
 * `cost-budget.hook` — bus subscriber that runs `CostBreachHandler.evaluate`
 * after each `step:completed`.
 *
 * Phase 4e of the dashboard consolidation. The plan §4.2.6 specifies this
 * as a hook subscriber at priority 30 — between `attachLearnersHook`
 * (priority 50) and `attachDashboardStateHook` (priority 10), so a breach
 * decision can mutate state the dashboard then broadcasts.
 *
 * Today's per-LLM-call breach evaluation lives inside
 * `dashboard-server.ts:agentManager.setCostHook()`. That path stays in
 * place — it's finer-grained (per-model-invocation) and catches breaches
 * mid-step. This bus hook is **additive**: it adds an end-of-step
 * checkpoint, useful for stages whose LLM calls don't all flow through
 * `agentManager` (e.g. headless adapter calls in Phase 4f's lifted
 * Steps). No flag — both paths can coexist; `breachHandler.evaluate` is
 * idempotent (it persists state and skips work when a breach already
 * exists).
 *
 * Phase 4f decides whether to drop the per-LLM-call hook in favor of
 * this one. Until then, both run.
