 * builds the SpawnConfig and by `BuiltinToolExecutor` when filtering its
 * advertised schemas (the model never even learns about denied tools).
 *
 * Tool taxonomy (matches agent-core/src/tools/builtin.ts):
 *   - read   → read_file, grep, glob, list
 *   - write  → write_file, edit
 *   - exec   → bash
