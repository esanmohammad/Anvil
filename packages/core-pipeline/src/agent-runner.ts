/**
 * `AgentRunner` — the canonical agent invocation surface used by
 * stage logic in this package.
 *
 * Both consumers (cli's lightweight runner backed by `single-shot.ts`
 * and dashboard's heavyweight runner backed by `AgentManager.spawn`)
 * implement this same shape, so a single `runXxxStage` function works
 * unchanged for both. The result type is widened from the previous
 * cli-only `{output, tokenEstimate}` to expose what dashboard needs
 * (cost, cache, stop reason, agentId for live updates).
 *
 * Lives in core-pipeline because stage logic is owned here; the cli
 * and dashboard packages re-export this for back-compat with their
 * existing imports.
